# C Programming


These are my C programming journey from having no idea at all to getting to know what C programming is a little...
Literally I had no idea what C programming is about 4 weeks ago.. and still don't know what exactly it is, but I'm working hard on it right now. 
Every single one of you who has no idea what C programming is! Hope you guys can get help a little from my journey on here.
